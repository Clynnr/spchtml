                  According to all known laws
                  of aviation,
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  there is no way a bee
                  should be able to fly.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Its wings are too small to get
                  its fat little body off the ground.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The bee, of course, flies anyway
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  because bees don't care
                  what humans think is impossible.

                  Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
                  Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Ooh, black and yellow!
                  Let's shake it up a little.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Barry! Breakfast is ready!
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Ooming!
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Hang on a second.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Hello?
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  - Barry?
                  - Adam?
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  - Oan you believe this is happening?
                  - I can't. I'll pick you up.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Looking sharp.

                  Use the stairs. Your father
                  paid good money for those.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Sorry. I'm excited.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Here's the graduate.
                  We're very proud of you, son.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  A perfect report card, all B's.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Very proud.
